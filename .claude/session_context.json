      "status": "Completed successfully",
      "notes": "Claude Code deconstructed a huge shader, extracted only the laser-relevant components, set correct values. Regular Claude struggled with this for hours and produced a barely-acceptable result."

  "fog_machine_problem": {
    "goal": "Realistic fog/smoke machine effect in Unity particle system",
    "desired_behavior": {
      "at_emitter": "Thick, dense smoke - particles tightly clustered",
      "mid_range": "Mass of smoke moves together with momentum, begins slowing",

      "symptom": "Particles are evenly spaced near the base, looks like a bead string not smoke",
      "root_cause": "Setting high startSpeed causes each particle to immediately rocket away from origin on spawn, creating even spacing regardless of emission rate"

      "start_speed": "Low (0.5-2), NOT high velocity",
      "emission_rate": "Massive (500-1000+/sec) so particles stack at the nozzle",

      "external_force": "Use a force zone or wind to push the whole MASS forward",
      "key_insight": "Density comes from particles born on top of each other and staying close. Cloud movement comes from external forces pushing the group, NOT individual particle startSpeed."
